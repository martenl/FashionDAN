Welcome to Fashion D(isplay)A(dvertising)N(etwork)

This is just a personal playground to try out some technologies(Kafka, GraphQL, gRPC, ...) in a non trivial setup.

The setup is, that there is a advertising admin (under Admin)
written in Java/Spring Boot with which you can create advertising campaigns and an ad server (under AdServer) written in
Java/VertX that will serve the ads to third party sites.
